The purpose of the product carousel is to provide a scrollable layout designed to be used only with product cards, as the carousel will display different numbers of items depending on the viewport width.

Product carousel takes a single object as props, the cms object, which contains the following structure:

{
  {  
  "cms-content": {    
  "backendImages": {      
    "desktopImage": "/content/defaultBackgroundImage.jpeg.transform/desktop/img.jpeg",      
    "mobileImage": "/content/defaultBackgroundImage.jpeg.transform/mobile/img.jpeg"    
    },    
  "productHeadline": "ljsfsjfjsj",    
  "productId": "CX88UCV"  }
  }
}
